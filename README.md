# disint8080 | Disassembler for Intel 8080 CPU

A simple disassembler for converting executable 8080 files into assembly. written in C.

## Why? 

It's fun to do and would be a nice tool for my emulator projects as a debugger. 

## Bulild instuctions

just ``` make ``` with gcc and ``` ./disint 8080 your_executable ```

## TODO
- [ ] make a intel 8080 emulator 
- [ ] a little refactoring both file structure and code
